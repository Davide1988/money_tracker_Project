i-Coins Budget Tracker

Hi, 

In order to make this web-program work you have to create a database called money_tracker, you can do this by typing the following command in your terminal:

createdb money_tracker

the next step will be to create the tables we need to store the data for the program, we can do this by entering the folder money_tracker/db and type the following:

psql -d money_tracker -f money_tracker.sql
